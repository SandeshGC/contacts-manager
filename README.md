# contacts-manager
ahhhhh, smells like web app.
-created a web app using window.prompt() function in javascript that manages contacts temporarily.ðŸ¤“
-built this while learning javascript basics.
-This app is not useful in real world as it stores and manages contacts temporarily and was built just for learning.
-I will create a new app in the future where this idea will be used.
